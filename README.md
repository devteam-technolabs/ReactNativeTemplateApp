## Why Expo and not React Native CLI?

We have been using Expo as our main framework since the introduction of [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) concept.

We think this question is not valid anymore, especially after the last React conference when the core React native team recommended using Expo for new projects.

> "As of today, the only recommended community framework for React Native is Expo.
